# Ultimate Testcase

This an ultimate testcase for the situations when you applied for a senior positions, even middle, included your portfolio with your best projects but anyways have been asked to do a coding test.

Frequently, this means scam or absolute lack of respect for you, your experience and especially your time. Our company - our rules.

- It was always funny to see how "no time to check your PoRtFoLiO, we have a lot of candidates", but we have time to check their "test" code.
- Moreover, there's no big company with such attitude. In 10 cases out of 10, it is some no-name company or a startup that is not even funded yet, playing like "you dreamt of this position, so prove you deserve it".

So instead of just ignoring that RED FLAG LLC, send this code snippet as "test".
